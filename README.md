# Firebase Realtime Database Xamarin Sample
Use this sample as a way to understand how to Get, Post, and Delete to a Firebase Realtime Database in a Xamarin Forms app. 

This sample uses the NuGet FirebaseDatabase.net: https://www.nuget.org/packages/FirebaseDatabase.net/

Note: This app will **not** run because the Config folder is missing. Use your own Firebase values for the Firebase Client and Auth.

```C#
public class ConfigFirebase
{
    public static string FirebaseClient = "your firebase DB url";
    public static string FrebaseSecret = "your app secret";
}
```
